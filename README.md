Overview
This project is built using Vite (with React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Framer Motion. These technologies were chosen for their efficiency, scalability, and developer-friendly features. This README provides an overview of the architectural choices made in this project and instructions on how to run it.

Architectural Choices

1. Vite (with React)
   Vite is a build tool that offers fast, efficient front-end development. It provides lightning-fast build times by leveraging native ES module imports and other modern web standards. Coupled with React, it enables a seamless development experience with efficient hot module replacement.

2. TypeScript
   TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to your code. It improves code quality and helps catch bugs at compile time. With TypeScript, you get better tooling support and improved developer experience.

3. Tailwind CSS
   Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. It promotes a highly maintainable and scalable way of styling applications.

4. React Router
   React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables dynamic routing by allowing you to declare routes in a declarative manner. This helps in building Single Page Applications (SPAs) with seamless navigation.

5. Framer Motion
   Framer Motion is a popular animation library for React. It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating animations and gestures. This library was chosen to add engaging animations to the project.
